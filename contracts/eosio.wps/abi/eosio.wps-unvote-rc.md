# Action - `{{ unvote }}`

## Description

The intent of the `{{ unvote }}` action is to vote toward a `{{ proposal_id }}` according to the rules of the EOS Worker Proposal System.

I, `{{ voter }}`, wish to remove my vote toward `{{ proposal_id }}` as per the rules of the EOS Worker Proposal System.

I, `{{ voter }}`, agree that I never accepted anything of value in return for the `{{ unvote }}` action toward the `{{ proposal_id }}`.
