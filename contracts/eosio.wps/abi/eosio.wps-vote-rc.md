# Action - `{{ vote }}`

## Description

The intent of the `{{ vote }}` action is to vote toward a `{{ proposal_id }}` according to the rules of the EOS Worker Proposal System.

I, `{{ voter }}`, wish to vote `{{ is_agree }}` toward `{{ proposal_id }}` as per the rules of the EOS Worker Proposal System. 

I recognize that the weight of my vote is equal to the proportion of my staked tokens to the staked tokens owned by all account holders who used the `{{ vote }}` action in relation to this proposal.

I recognize that if `{{ is_agree }}` is true, I am voting for the `{{ proposal }}`. If `{{ is_agree }}` is false, I am voting against the `{{ proposal_id }}`.

I, `{{ voter }}`, agree that I never accepted anything of value in return for the `{{ is_agree }}` toward the `{{ proposal_id }}`.
