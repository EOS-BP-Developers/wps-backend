# Action - `{{ vote }}`

## Description

The intent of the {{vote}} action is to vote toward a `proposal` according to the rules of the EOS Commons Fund system.

I, {{voter}}, wish to vote {{vote_param}} toward {{proposal}} as per the rules of the EOS Commons Fund system. I recognize that the weight of my vote is equal to the proportion of my staked tokens to the staked tokens owned by all account holders who used the {{vote}} action in relation to this proposal.

I, {{ voter }}, agree that I never accepted anything of value in return for the {{ vote }} action toward the {{ proposal }}.
