# Action - `{{ regcommittee }}`

## Description

The intent of the `regcommittee` action is to register an account as an official committee in the EOS Commons Fund system.

The {{committee}} account is controlled by a multisig signing key that can have different privileges depending on the threshold of signers reached. The exact signing privilege rules are outlined in the {{committee}} charter and implemented with the registration of the committee.
